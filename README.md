# Advanced Traffic Simulation (ATS)

ATS is a simulation on a whole new level. The original idea was to make non graphical simulation, but during planning and development of the project we thought about setting another target: develop as a game. So now this project is heading towards being a simulation of the real world traffic. This means you can create your individual world from data like OpenStreetMap (or similar) and create an 3D environment from it. The focus of this game/simulation lies on the public transport system. In this world you can grow your own traffic company to transport people from one place to another by using taxis, trains, trams, busses and any other vehicle. You have to create schedules, hire drivers, manage your company, deal with political decisions, and a lot lot lot more.

Main features:

  - Manage public transport in a region of your choice
  - Everything will influence your game world (e.g. building a new road or bridge, will maybe block existing roads during its build process)
  - Every human or inhabitant of your world has an individual life
  - Simulation of everyday situations like going to work/school, sports and a lot more
  - AI traffic by humans created by individual life
  - In game "Internet" so you can use tools like Google Maps, Route planners, Ã¶pnvkarte.de and a lot more on the base of your own world
  - Multiplayer (Most likely to come within 3rd big update after release)
  - Add-On architecture so that you can create own transport vehicles, in-world buildings, etc.
